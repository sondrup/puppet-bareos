# A time or duration speciﬁed in seconds. The time is stored internally as a 64 bit integer value, but it is speciﬁed in two parts: a number part and a modiﬁer part. The number can be an integer or a ﬂoating point number. If it is entered in ﬂoating point notation, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. The modiﬁer is mandatory and follows the number part, either with or without intervening spaces. The following modiﬁers are permitted:
# seconds
# minutes
#   (60 seconds)
# hours
#   (3600 seconds)
# days
#   (3600*24 seconds)
# weeks
#   (3600*24*7 seconds)
# months
#   (3600*24*30 seconds)
# quarters
#   (3600*24*91 seconds)
# years
#   (3600*24*365 seconds)
# Any abbreviation of these modiﬁers is also permitted (i.e. seconds may be speciﬁed as sec or s). A speciﬁcation of m will be taken as months.
# The speciﬁcation of a time may have as many number/modiﬁer parts as you wish. For example:
#
# 1 week 2 days 3 hours 10 mins
# 1 month 2 days 30 sec
# are valid date speciﬁcations.
